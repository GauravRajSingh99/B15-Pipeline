1) Since, if we have to deploy application, automate it, make pipeline of it, then we should atleast know the manual process to deploy that application.
2) Our application was of react JS, so manual process is as below
3) $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory) – It is a predefined variable 
4) Writing pipeline
i) 
ii) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – node installer
iii) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – npm
iv) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – npm
v) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – upload so select “Publish Pipeline Artifacts”
vi) Now run pipeline so our build is ready 
vii) Now we can see our build has come into azure artifacts 
5) Now we have to deploy these artifacts on our frontend vm in deploy stage 


6) All stages run on different different agents
7) Now we have to download our artefacts 
8) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – download pipeline artifacts
9) Now use or create service connection 
10) SEARCH IN ASSISTANT – copy files over ssh
11) While running pipeline got below 
12) So to resolve above permission error we will do so 
13) SEARCH – SSH
14) update as below 
15) SEARCH – SSH
16) Now got below error 
17) Remove todo folder as below from frontend vm
18) Rename todo as todo 1
19) Now run pipeline
So it is working but showing this ##[error]bash: readyTimeout:: command not found
